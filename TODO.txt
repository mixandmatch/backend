- Use /mam-backend/src/main/resources/database.properties instead of /src/main/resources/META-INF/spring/database.properties
  in applicationContext.xml:
	-> Problem: Keep JUnit Tests that are running within Eclipse functional.
			Modify context to load a default properties file during tests? / Load different context in tests? (Context is defined using: @ContextConfiguration)
- Replace existing logging that users log4j with logback. Once that is done log4j.properties can be deleted.
	Example of logback logging: /src/test/java/de/metafinanz/mam/backend/repository/UserTest.java

Services to implement:
- CreateOrGetUser: Create User and return ID or return ID of exiting user
- removeParticipant
- getAppointmentsForLocation
- get Appointments only for future events (getAppointments, getAppointmentsForLocation)
- Add findAppointmentsByUser Find appointments where the user is either the owner or a participant
- Modify addParticipant to be able to use a username or an ID as param

Update and refactor Test clients

Nice to have:
- removeLocation
- deleteAppointment:
	At the moment there is no way available to authenticate the owner
	-> Simple solution: addAppointment returns a secret to the client
	   This is needed when the appointment should be deleted
