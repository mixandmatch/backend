- Use /mam-backend/src/main/resources/database.properties instead of /src/main/resources/META-INF/spring/database.properties
  in applicationContext.xml:
	-> Problem: Keep JUnit Tests that are running within Eclipse functional.
			Modify context to load a default properties file during tests? / Load different context in tests? (Context is defined using: @ContextConfiguration)
- Replace existing logging that users log4j with logback. Once that is done log4j.properties can be deleted.
	Example of logback logging: /src/test/java/de/metafinanz/mam/backend/repository/UserTest.java

Services to implement:
- addParticipant: Enforce a maximum of 4 (Cristian)
	- transactional to prevent race conditions
- Add GPS data to location, Define GPS format (Tobi)
- removeAppointment: Only by owner? (Cristian)
	- delete appointment automatically if owner is removed
		At the moment there is no way available to authenticate the owner
		-> Simple solution: addAppointment returns a secret to the client
	   This is needed when the appointment should be deleted
	- delete appointment automatically if participants list is empty (owner counts as participant, automatically add to list)
- removeLocation (Alex)

General stuff:
- MySQL deployment (Phil)
- Improve Error handling (Tobi)
- Improve Interfaces (return always a json-Object?)
- Update and refactor Test clients (README in doc -> soapui) (Tobi)

Security: (Phil)
	- How to do it?
	- Spring Security?
	- User: Add password
		- Keep alternative without account? (Doodle Style)
	- Security Token for clients (store as salted hash)

Future:
- Prevent the creation of new appointments if there is already one with < 4 participants for the location.
